# Predictive-Modelling-Binary-Classifier-with-Tensorflow

### How to clean/tidy data, build a classifier model with TensorFlow, and train to get final results.

### Process
* In this repo we will start from scratch, meaning we will clean/tidy the initial data.
* Then we will start to build our predictive model with appropriate estimator models from the beautiful world of TensorFlow.
* After creating the model we can begin training.
* Once the training is successfully done we need to assess the accuracy of our model in a detailed report.
